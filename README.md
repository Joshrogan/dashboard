# CloudFirst Deployment Pipeline Dashboard

You need a .env file that contains the REACT_APP_ACCESS_KEY_ID and REACT_APP_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY values to run this project locally successfully. These are AWS account credentials so I won't be able to provide these in this public repo unfortunately.


https://www.dashboarddemo2021.com/ is a live demo of that site, feel free to rerun pipelines/stages and approve or reject stuff.
